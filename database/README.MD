# 🚀 Vector Database & Qdrant

## 🔍 What is a Vector Database?
A vector database is a specialized type of database designed to store, index, and retrieve high-dimensional vector embeddings efficiently. These embeddings represent data points in a continuous vector space, allowing for similarity searches using distance metrics such as cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or dot product.

Vector databases are widely used in machine learning 🤖, recommendation systems 🎯, image retrieval 🖼️, natural language processing (NLP) 📝, and other AI applications where finding similar objects in a high-dimensional space is crucial.

### ⭐ Key Features of a Vector Database:
- **⚡ Efficient similarity search**: Uses Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) algorithms for fast querying.
- **📈 Scalability**: Handles large-scale datasets with billions of vectors.
- **📌 Indexing techniques**: Includes HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World), IVF (Inverted File Index), and PQ (Product Quantization).
- **🔎 Metadata filtering**: Enables filtering based on additional attributes.
- **🌍 Distributed and high-performance**: Optimized for handling real-time queries in production systems.

   ```

4. **📥 Inserting Vectors:**
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   client.upsert(collection_name="my_collection", points=[
       {"id": 1, "vector": np.random.rand(128).tolist(), "payload": {"category": "tech"}},
       {"id": 2, "vector": np.random.rand(128).tolist(), "payload": {"category": "sports"}},
   ])
   ```

5. **🔍 Performing a Search:**
   ```python
   search_results = client.search(
       collection_name="my_collection", 
       query_vector=np.random.rand(128).tolist(), 
       limit=5
   )
   ```
